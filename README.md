Sdl Pong
========
This is a simple pong game coded using SDL2. The point of this project is to
help me learn how to use SDL.


Dependencies
------------
+ SDL2
+ glog (Google's logging library)
+ gflags
+ boost
+ eigen3

Note that the makefile uses pkg-config to find libraries.

Controls
--------
Still working on things, but for now:
  + UP and DOWN arrows to move the left paddle
  + SPACE to restart game once someone scores
  + ESC to pause game (game starts paused by default)
